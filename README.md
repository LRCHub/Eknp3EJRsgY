# [Alexandros] – El Camino

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I landed on the globe
Breathe the air
I felt my heart beat was
pumping up and down
Conveying the blood
I met a man on globe
He was kind of hard to explain
Coz he looked like me instead
of being someone
＜♪＞
I was in my house
Swimming inside the internet
Absorbing information that
I don't really need
I've got my feet to stand
I've got my shoes to walk around
I've got no map but
I've got soul
And nothing to lose
And now
Get my visa
Apply for my passport and
get ready to take off!
Moving back and forth
And getting all the crowds
in my hand
But that's just a little news
inside a little town
I can see the world is waiting
for someone to explore …
Going back and forth
I've been to many places before
But that's just a little news
inside a little earth
I can say this conversation's
getting complex and bizarre
Why don't we break up?
＜♪＞
I lost my way out here
Don't know where to go
Wait a sec!
Where is my country and
my house?
I'm gonna leave with you
How about a little trip?
New Zealand or Nebraska
I don't have work or family
And nothing to lose
And now
Get my visa
Apply for my passport and
get ready to take off
Moving back and forth
And getting all the crowds
in my hand
But that's just a little news
inside a little town
I can see the world is waiting
for someone to explore …
Going back and forth
I loved so many people before
But that's just a little news
inside a little earth
I can say this conversation's
getting complex and bizarre
Why don't we make love ?
